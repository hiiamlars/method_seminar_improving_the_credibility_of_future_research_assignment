Method Seminar: Improving the credebility of future Research (Assignment)

This repository contains all material for the final assignment of the course "Method seminar: Improving the credebility of future research: Digital Project management, data preparation and visualization" at the University of Bern in the fall semester 2024.

In particular, the course aimed to enable students to analyze raw data in a robust, verifiable and reproducible way using R Studio, thus strengthening the entire research process. It was aimed at masters students of psychology.

Named course covered the following content:

- Data wrangling - using R and the {tidyverse} including {dplyr}, {tidyr}, and {stringr}
- Visualisation - using {ggplot2} and supporting packages
- Reproducible reports - using {RMarkdown}
- Version control - using GitHub

This repository is structured as follows: All other files than this README are placed within "plotting assignment". Within "plotting assignment" there is a further distinction between (1) a folder "data" that contains all applied data from external sources (none in the case of this specific assignment) and (2) a folder "code" that contains all code used to clean, tidy, prepare and plot the data in a way which was demanded by the instructions of the assignment.

Note: The geographical data used witin the "assignment.rmd" file was taken from the `rnaturalearth` package. The data might not be complete or correct. The survey data used within the "assignment.rmd" file was simulated within the script. This data therefore makes no claim of completeness or correctness either. Please be aware of these limitations when interpreting the results.
